# The Silicon Playground

An interactive educational application designed to help visualize and understand fundamental computer science concepts. This project provides hands-on modules for topics such as:

*   Logic Gates
*   Combinational and Sequential Circuits
*   A Mini CPU Simulation
*   The LC-3 Architecture Memory Map
*   And more!

## Running the Project Locally

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
*   npm

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PlayaOW/CS-Simulation.git
    cd CS-Simulation
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Run the following command to install the necessary packages.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
